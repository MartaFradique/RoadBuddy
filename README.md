# RoadBuddy


Welcome to RoadBuddy
This app wants to offer a digital solution whose main goal is to help motorcyclists make their trips safer, more dynamic, and exciting. To achieve this, we aim to offer users features such as:
<br/>
- An interactive map that allows users to locate nearby motorcyclists and view their basic information, such as name and phone number, thereby facilitating any requests for help/collaboration.
- Communication between motorcyclists, enhancing the organization of group trips and meetups.
- View the nearest gas stations and their respective prices on the interactive map.
- Observe points of interest for motorcyclists and possible meeting points on the map.
- An alarm system, for example, through the detection of falls with the motion sensor.

With these features, the application helps make motorcycle trips safer and more enjoyable, as well as encouraging communication and the creation of new friendships among motorcyclists.
